        "text": "The coordinate offsets (x and y) can be any positive or negative length. A positive x value moves the shadow to the right, while a negative value moves it to the left. A positive y value moves the shadow to the bottom, while a negative value moves it to the top. This means the values don’t exactly map to a cartesian plane, but rather an imaginary global light source in the top left corner of the document."

        "title": "Blur and spread radius",
        "text": "The blur radius value can be any positive length, where larger values makes the shadow larger but also more spread out, lightening the overall shadow. The spread radius value can be any positive or negative length and will expand or contract the shadow. Setting the blur radius to 0 and the spread radius to any value greater than 1 will create a sharp edged shadow offset."

If the number of shadows differ between animation states, a default “shadow” with 0 length values and a transparent color are used, which results in a consistent animation effect that doesn’t flicker shadows."
