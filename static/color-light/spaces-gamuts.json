This is a nuanced issue most developers wonâ€™t need to worry about, but basically `sRGB` applies gamma correction to colors to keep them consistent between viewing devices. This is preferred when rendering colors directly as backgrounds, text, etc. but a pain when applying light shading to a 3D object.[citation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html)"
